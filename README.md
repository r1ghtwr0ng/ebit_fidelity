# Ebit fidelity
Repository for the research and analysis of entangled bit (ebit) fidelity in a FSO (Free Space Optics) switch.
Uses the netsquid quantum network simulation software to test the behaviour of the switch in datacenter network topologies.

## Installation
I suggest setting up a python virtual environment to install the packages in. Make sure to export the login credentials for the netsquid pypy  to install the packages in. Make sure to install netsquid seperately, it's a bit of a pain and requires login creds (see [docs](https://docs.netsquid.org/latest-release/INSTALL.html)):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
